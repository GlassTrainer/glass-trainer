{"name":"Glass Trainer","tagline":"Main project of Glass Trainer which includes persistence, service, controllers and angularjs client application.","body":"### Welcome to Glass Trainer Home Page.\r\n\r\nGlass Trainer is a project that combines wearable technologies and sport training. This project includes Google Glass and Arduino sensors. There are Arduino sensors on the athlete’s clothes to measure the heart rate and acceleration.\r\n\r\nTrainers can see these data while coaching the athletes on her/his Google Glass screen. In this way, trainer uses only Google Glass without the necessity any extra tools to collect these data. Because Google Glass is hands-free mode, trainer may observe the athletes more effectively and efficiently. At the same time, there is GPS (Global Positioning Sensor) to collect the location of the athlete. Also, collected locations of the athletes can be seen on Google Maps.\r\n\r\nBesides, there is a website of this project. All collected data may be accessed through this website. In this way, trainers may observe the data of training session, compare the data of previous training sessions. Also, athletes may access their own data. In this project, trainers and athletes meet the new technologies in the training sessions.\r\n\r\nThe video presents Glass Trainer project can be accessed here: \r\nhttps://youtu.be/AVhngI5RCH0\r\n\r\n### Used technologies in this project\r\nSpring Framework ( Core, Context, MVC, Security),\r\n\r\nHibernate,\r\n\r\nAngularJS,\r\n\r\nBootstrap,\r\n\r\nSome other open source libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse Apache Tomcat application server if you want to use the application.\r\n\r\n### Links to side repositories of Glass Trainer Project.\r\n[Data Collector and Desktop Application](https://github.com/srhtcn/glass-trainer-data-collector)\r\n\r\n[Arduino Application](https://github.com/srhtcn/glass-trainer-arduino)\r\n\r\n[Android Google Glass Application](https://github.com/srhtcn/glass-trainer-android)\r\n\r\n\r\n### For more information look at our reports written for TÜBİTAK Software Development Contest (in Turkish)\r\n[Tasarım Raporu](http://issuu.com/serhatcan9/docs/tubitak_glass_tasarim_raporu)\r\n\r\n[Sonuç Raporu](http://issuu.com/serhatcan9/docs/tubitak_glass_sonuc_raporu)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJülide Hülya Şengül (@jhsengul),\r\n\r\nFerhat Yaldıran (@fyaldiran), \r\n\r\nZeki Bozbıyık (@ZekiBozbiyik)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThis project's development does not continue anymore.
